<!-- Swap and solve 1

Dear CTO,

I want you to make a website that will help the user to make approximate calculation of their bitcoin purchase.


First when user enters the website, it should popup a message to enter their name and age and then display it on a popup
with welcome message. (make sure a user can only move forward whrn he/she is 18 yrs of age or above).
 also display the name in upper-case. [week 5]

then it should ask the user to enter the amount of bitcoin they want to buy, (amount can be in decimals also) and then
multiply the amount by the price of one bitcoin. in the calculations make sure to add the transaction charges as well.
and display the final approximate amount. [week 6]

at the end create a button which submitts all the information. also when you move your cursor over the button it should display
"Bitcoin is the King !"[week 7] -->
